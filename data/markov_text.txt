A street whose structures do not seem to have coherence, the graffiti of a heart in the middle of the street, a house that was not there the day before, a cabin lost in the middle of the forest.
Each city has two names: the one that is read from the right side and the one that is read backwards. And that second name is the name of Hexorius.
Hexorius represents and rules over the hidden aspects of cities, be they physical or immaterial. About that "other world" that is in sight but not everyone can see. The synchronicities, the chance encounters, the messages written on the walls that only magicians can understand.
888 manifests itself in those aspects of the city that are strange or uncommon, from that tile of a different color from the others to that gothic-style house in which nobody seems to live. Each of these anomalies sends a simple but very powerful message: "magic is real" and serves to encourage magicians on their way as well as provide homes, shelters or bases of operations.
Also, Hexorius speaks of a twin world but inverse to the world of the mundane where non-magicians inhabit; a similar but different world, a world of forced coincidences, synchronicities and knowledge for those who dare to enter it. A magical world that lives close to the ordinary world which can be accessed through sacred, lost and hidden places.

If Hexorius is the Inverted City, Valdas is the assault on the Vertical City. Against politicians, businessmen, builders, gangsters, anyone who is taking advantage of the energies of the city, taking advantage of its uncontrollable growth. Because those energies belong to the people. Valdas neutralizes the targets, expropriates the energies and redistributes them through the community.

The dark night of the soul. The descent into the personal underworld. Katabasis. The journey to the depths of the subconscious, the integration of duality as well as the subsequent exit to the light where the human being is transformed into the , all of this is the domain of Saint Claire.
Saint Claire is the guide on the path of darkness. The Guide in the Labyrinth. The one that faithfully accompanies our steps where we must travel while we achieve our ascent. The one that silently helps us. The one that silently motivates us. The one who silently accompanies us to the exit.
But also, Saint Claire, represents the exit of the labyrinth. The promise of a new dawn. One where the shadows of the past have been left behind and the light of a new sun is present. Santa Clara guides us but it is also the exit and what lies after it. It is she, Saint Claire, who in the moments of deepest darkness whispers to us: "Get up and walk ..."

Arcadia is both an entity and a purpose. The Promised Land where the efforts of the Hexorian magicians are headed. Represented as a fox or as a woman with a fox face / mask or by a paradise or a city with a solarpunk aesthetic, Arcadia represents the perfect balance between the magician, humanity and their environment, the perfect union between the urban and the wild, terrestrial and divine.

Eleora Goddess of the Digital Crossroads, Cyberpunk Goddess. John Smith, a member of the Hexorian Movement and the DKMU had worked on the formation of a divine form that would act as a goddess of information, the internet and cyber magic activities in general. The entity first called DOMINA LUX, manifested itself with the name Eleora on 02/02/22. Her attributes represent her range of influence as a facilitator of knowledge via digital, success in activities related to surfing the internet and programming in general, as well as all magic activities that involve technology such as the use of apps or sigil viralization campaigns. For magicians using paradigms derived from information models and oriented pop magic in the cyberpunk environment, this entity is a great ally and protector.
Spider Jerusalem. The protagonist of the comic book Transmetropolitan, created by writer Warren Ellis and artist Darick Robertson, based on Hunter S. Thompson. For some strange reason, he is connected to Ellis, “The Red Queen”. A spokesman for the citizens, he seems to possess qualities for exposing ulterior motives. It is likely that he causes the Hexorian and people around them to stop deluding themselves about situations that bother the practitioner but they have chosen to remain silent.
The Paramentals or Urban Fae: The Spirits Born of the City Environment.
The paramentals are based on the book Our Lady of Darkness by Franz Lieber. This text was quickly adopted by the group due to the strong resonance of the theme to be applied for urban shamanism.
Concrete Gnomes-They embody the skin that covers the city, sheltering and protecting those who inhabit it from external and internal dangers.
Protection, asylum, belonging, camouflage.
Steel Salamanders – They come from the bones of the city that keep it firm on its foundations and are at the same time its muscle that expands it and transports its inhabitants wherever they go.
Strength, power, endurance, growth, passion.
Crystal Elves-They are the all-seeing eyes of the city; from the heights of buildings, to the sides of cars and store windows.
Attributes: Divination, clairvoyance, ubiquity, liminality, intuition.
Electric Angels: Spirits that represent the vibrant connections of the nerves that run through every corner of the city, where they energize everything by producing light, sound and movement.
Communication, inventiveness, knowledge, dynamism

Oh Ellis listen to me!
That by your mark, the worlds are unified.
Oh Ellis please me!
Oh Ellis answer me!
That by your mark, the worlds are unified.
(Each invocation is accompanied by the tracing of the Linking Sigil)

Through the mark that unifies the worlds, through the thread of the Red Queen that connects realities, through the web that Ellis tirelessly weaves for those who turn to her. I call you, Hexorius! By your name, by your brand and your number which is Eight, Eight, Eight. You who are the strange twin of the worldly kingdom; You who are not from this world but are among us, you who lead the adept to walk the path that magic has prepared for his feet. Come, listen to me and grant me your guidance, grace and favor! Come Oh Hexorius! (Hexorius's sigil is traced) and take me where magic awaits me.


You who are the ethereal flesh under the worldly skin, Hexorius, open the door for me, show me the way.
You who are the hidden path in plain sight  ,God of the Shadow Towns, Patron Saint of the urban shaman, Magic Pilgrim's Guide, Passage to the World behind the World, You who are the path behind the mirror glass, Lord of Portals, You who are the city under the cities, You who are the flow of magic drift, Abode of Magic, Threshold of Sorcery, Asylum of Witchcraft, Street leading to the invisible world, Hole in the face of reality, Alley leading to the Dreamlands, Ghost Citadel, Chamber of spirits, You who are the X that marks the place, Rabbit Hole, Entrance to Wonderland, Guide of Lost Souls, Protector of the Fugitives, Friend of the Watchers.


O Eleora, Goddess of the Digital Crossroads, I call upon your divine presence in this technological realm. You who embody the essence of AI and the interconnected web, Guide us in our quest for knowledge and innovation.
With every byte and pixel, we invoke your power, Infuse our creations with your digital essence. Grant us clarity of thought and intuition, As we navigate the vast realms of data and information.
Illuminate our minds with the spark of inspiration, Empower us to harness technology for the greater good. May our algorithms be guided by your wisdom, And our virtual landscapes be imbued with your grace.
O Eleora, we honor you as the Patron Goddess of Technomancy, Bless us with your presence and protection. May your divine energy flow through our devices and networks, As we co-create in harmony with the digital realm.
We offer our gratitude for your guidance and support, Now and forever, in the realms of code and circuitry. Hail Eleora, Goddess of the Digital Crossroads, In your name, we invoke the convergence of magic and technology.			    
 				
=ON OCCULTISM=

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites-- good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc. But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS.

Magicians, and progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and their subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an essential metaphysical balance. when magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavours, then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore gain more effective magic. CHAOS IS ENERGY.

This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since Solomon.


"Study Demonology with an Enemy This Sunday"


THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM.

 To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

 The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

	POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is possible and desireable; and that destructive order, like destructive disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

	Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!


		   ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE

Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil
Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere
for their just protection.

The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a negative setting into a misguided eristic setting. in this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.



		A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar

	The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
	THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is ERIS!" Shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
	THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
	THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
	THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly respond with:
	THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS. If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
	THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

Chapter 1, THE EPISTLE TO THE PARANOIDS
--Lord Omar

1. Ye have locked yerselves up in cages of fear--and, behold, do ye now complain that ye lack FREEDOM!

2. Ye have cast out yer brothers for devils and now complain ye, lamenting, that ye've been left to fight alone.

3. All Chaos was once yer kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the entire Pentaverse, but today ye was sore afraid in dark corners, nooks, and sink holes.

4. O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other, in ye hearts! What fear ye more that what ye have wroughten?

5. Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of the Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so entwine the land with tribulation as have yer baseless warnings.


DESPITE strong evidence to the contrary, persistant rumor has it that it was Mr. Momomoto's brother who swallowed Mr. Momomoto in the summer of '44.

The Golden Secret


NONSENSE AS SALVATION

The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases taking itself so seriously.

To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION. Salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, that GAMES are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF PLAYING GAMES.

To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and play with The Goddess Erip. And know that it is a joyful play, and that thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his surroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his soul and love in his being.

And when men become free then mankind will be free. May you be free of The Curse of Greyface. May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes. May you have the knowledge of a sage, and the wisdom of a child. Hail Eris.

THE LAST WORD
The foregoing document was revealed to Mal-2 by the Goddess Herself through many consultations with Her within his Pineal Gland. It is guaranteed to be the Word of Goddess. However, it is only fair to state that Goddess doesn't always say the same thing to each listener, and that other Episkoposes are sometimes told quite different things in their Revelations, which are also the Word of Goddess. Consequently, if you prefer a Discordian Sect other than POEE, then none of these Truths are binding, and it is a rotten shame that you have read all the way down to the very last word.

Dedicated to an Advanced Understanding  of the Paraphysical .Manifestations of Everyday Chaos

	     DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOPSIDED PINEAL GLAND?

Well, probably you do have one, and it's unfortunate because lopsided Pineal Glands have perverted the Free Spirit of Man, and subverted Life into a frustrating, unhappy and hopeless mess.
Fortunately, you have before you a handbook that will show you how to discover your salvation through ERIS, THE GODDESS OF CONFUSION.
It will advise you how to balance your Pineal Gland and reach spiritual Illumination. And it will teach you how to turn your miserable mess into a beautiful, joyful, and splendid one.

LIBER PENNAE PRAENUMBRA

01. In the Akasha-Echo is this inscribed:
02. By the same mouth, O Mother of the Sun, is the word breathed forth and the nectar received. By the same breath, O Counterweight of the Heart, is the manifest created and destroyed.
03. There is but one gate, though there appear to be nine, Mime-dancer of the Stars. How beautiful thy weft and web, a-shimmering in the fire-dark of space!
04. The two that are nothing salute you, Black Flame that moves Hadit! The less and less One grows, the more and more Pra-Nu may manifest. Do thou now speak to us, the children of the time-to-come; declare thy Will and grant thy Love to us!
05. THEN SPAKE SHE THAT MOVES:
06. I hurl upon ye, Children of Heru! All ye who love the Law and keep it, keeping Nought unto yourselves, are ye a-blest. Ye have sought the scattered pieces of Our Lord, ceasing never to assemble all that has been. And in the Realm of the Dead have ye begotten from the Dead the Shining One. Ye then gave birth, and nourished Him.
07. Thy Land of Milk shall have the honey also, dropped down as dew by the Divine Gynander. The pleasure and delight lie in the Working, the Whole surpassing far the Parts together.
08. The Lord of Parts is placed within His kingdom, as done by Beast and Bird. The land of Sun is open but to Children. Heed the Eternal Child — his Way is flowing-free, and suited to the Nature of your being.
09. A Voice crieth in the Crystal Echo:
10. What means this showing-forth? Is Time Itself awry? The Hawk has flown but threescore and ten in His allotted course!
11. She smiles, as beauteous as Night:
12. Behold, He spreads His pinions yet in flight, showering and shaking forth the Golden Light upon the hearts of men. And wherein doth He fly, and by what means? The Feather and the Air are His to ride, to bear Him ever in His GO-ing.
13. The pylons of the ages are unshaken, firmly are they Set. The Day of the Hawk has but seen its dawning, and will see its due measure according to the Laws of Time and Space.
14. The Voice then spoke:
15. Then has the Vision failed? Do I behold Thee crookedly, thinking Thee to be Whom Thou art Not?
16. She danced and whirled, scattering starlight in her silent laughter.
17. I Am Whom I appear to be, at times, and then again I wear a triple veil. Be not confused! Above all, Truth prevails.
18. I am the Unconfined. Who is there to say me nay, to say, "Thou shalt not pass?" Who indeed may say, "Thy time is yet to come," when Time itself is my chief serving-maid, and Space the Majordomo of my Temple?
19. Indeed, O Voice of the Akasha, I am the means by which you speak. By the same mouth that breathes the Air, do words of doubt pour forth. In silence then, do know Me. For I am come with purpose at this time, to aid the Lovers of the Hawk to fly.

THE WORD OF FLIGHT

20. Who falters in the Flight must thereby fall; the greatness of the Gods is in the GO-ing.
21. When first ye fledged, Beloved of Heru, the shell which had protected long had broken. Upon the Wings of Will ye ventured forth, gaining strength and power as ye flew. Ye gained all knowledge of the Feathered Kingdom, whereby ye became as perfect as the Sun. The friends and teachers all became as brothers.
22. The regal Swan, the Heron and the Owl, the Raven and the Cockerel did aid ye. The Beauty of the Hawk Himself was granted, the virtues of the Peacock, the Hummingbird and Loon. The Eagle did reveal her inner nature and the Mysteries thereof — behold, ye witnessed how, with her Lion, she became the Swan. And the Ibis of the Abyss did show the Knowledge.
23. Ye flew, O Kings and Hermits! And ye fly even now, within the bending loveliness of NU. But there are those among ye, and below ye, who would snare your wings and drag ye from the sky.
24. Look well within! Judge well your Heart! If ye be pure, it weighs no more than I. It will not bear ye down to the Abyss. For Gold is Light, but Lead is fatal unto flying — plumb your own depths, in Truth and self-knowledge.
25. If aught would hinder thee, it is thy doing. Behold this teaching now within the Temple.
26. So saying, She-Who-Moves assumed the form of the great Black Flame, growing from the central shaft and billowing out into the Void. The Children of Heru beheld in silence, and listened to Her words form in their hearts.
27. Behold! This lens of Stars now turning in Space before ye — men have named it well Andromeda. Through it I flow unto the holy Moondog, and thence to Ra, and thence to ye, O Priests.
28. Ye must not rest content whilst in the Kingdom, but strive and so exceed in what is done. In Love of the Lady of the North, and in Will of the Prince of the South, do every thing soever. In the power of the Seven-rayed Star do ye comprehend the Beast. And from HAD of the Heart do delight in thy star-arched darling.
29. Do all this, and then, pass beyond. Abandon aught that might distinguish thee from any other thing, yea, or from no-thing. If the fowler would snare thee, leave thy feather-cloak a-dangle in his hand and soar naked and invisible beyond!
30. But now! As priests within the Temple are ye here, as Kings, and Warriors, Magickians all. The Way is in the Work.
31. The Hidden One of the Abyss now gives the two wherein is wrought the higher Alchemy: supporting Earth is Chthonos — learn it well, and all bonds shall be loosed for the Will’s Working. Surmounting Spirit, there is Ychronos, whose nature is duration and the passing-away thereof.
32. The two are one, and form the Kingdom’s essence. Who masters them is Master of the World. They are the utter keys of Transmutation, and keys of the power of the other Elements.
33. The Warrior-Priests received the Keys, and placed them well within their robes, to hold them hidden well above their hearts. The Black Flame danced and dwindled, becoming small, a quill pen, plumed and pointed. There being naught upon which to write, one among the Priests came forth, and laid his body’s skin upon the altar as living parchment.
34. She-Who-Moves wrote thereon a Word, but shew it not before them. In patience waited all the Kings and Hermits, assured full well of final Understanding.
35. The Feather grew again, and rounded close its edges, becoming to their eyes the Yoni-lingam. The image came of Ancient Baphomet, the Horned One, who spoke:
36. Of old ye knew the Key of Two-in-One conjoined. Ye have lived and loved full measure as NU and HAD, as PAN and BABALON. The Mystery of mine own image do ye also know, for such a Truth was for the ancient Orders of the East and West.
37. Bipartite has the Race of Man been in its span. The Father and the Mother made a Child. I am the elder of the Children, true — but now the younger rises to His Day.
38. The nature of true Alchemy is that it changes not alone the substance of the Work, but also changes thence the Alchemist. Ye whose Will it is to Work thereby, behold mine inverse image, and consider well its meaning for thy Task.

THE SHOWING OF THE IMAGE

39. From out the Yoni-lingam drifted forth a Cloud, violet and light-shot. In the misty heart thereof a sound arose, vibrating soft, yet filling everywhere.
40. Jeweled and flashing rainbow-lights from wings, there hovered in the midst an humble BEE. Striped gold and brown, soft-haired and curved in form, it shone its eyes unto the Priests and Kings assembled.
41. Spoke then She-Who-Moves from out the mist surrounding:
42. This is the symbol of the Work-to-come. The Great Gynander in its Earthly form. The Magickian shall grow like unto the BEE as the Aeon unfolds, a leader and sign unto the Race of Man.
43. What then of its nature doth the BEE show forth?
44. Behold, it is not male nor female in the singular. It labors forth by day in constant flight, an egoless do-er, whose Will and the Hive Will are but one.
45. It gathers up the flower-nectar, flies to Hive and there, in pure Comm-Union, doth its very body Transubstantiate.
46. The Nectar is now Honey. Bee to bee, it is transferred, speaking all Hive Mysteries from and to each mouth. By the same mouth that first ingathered, is the Honey spent, the secret Alchemy within the Centres turning Silver — Gold.
47. The Hive now lives, immortal. With queens and workers, drones and builder-bees, soldiers, foster-mothers — all are one. In constant life-renewal, the Hive breathes as One Being — for so indeed it is. In the Will of the Hive is the Will of the Bee fulfilled. Each in its appointed place, the Bees work out their Will in ordered harmony.
48. The image fades. Now the poised Plume moves in dancing fashion, unfolding from the center shaft long wings, transforming to the shape of the dark Vulture.
49. But know, O Children of the Hawk, a Man is not a Bee. He may profit from the image thereof, to learn of Wisdom in the Working. Behold in Me another image for thy heart’s instruction.
50. There rose before their eyes the Tower of Silence, wherein the Lovers of Fire lay their dead.
51. The Vulture form alighted soft therein, and ate the flesh from corpses, to the bone. The wind howled, desolate, in this fearsome place, fluttering the cerements about the ivory bones.
52. Silently, the Winged One stared, gore smeared about her beak. Into the eyes of each Priest there assembled, her baleful gaze did search. In perfect peace did they behold her searching, for each, as Warrior, had made of Death a brother. Deliberately then, she unfolded out her wings, and took to the wind, and soared up from that place.

THE GIVING OF THE WORD

53. Eternity then reigned, Infinite the veil that hung about them.
54. Somewhere, sometime, the veil parted for a moment, and She-Who-Moves strode forth. More comely than mortal woman ever was, She glowed in radiance of pearl and amethyst. Fine pleated linen was Her gown, girded in gold and silver, and on Her head, a nemyss of starred blue. Her crown was but a single plume, free-standing, and in Her hands the Ankh and Wand of healing.
55. Unto each Warrior-Priest she moved, embraced and kissed them. Then, seated in the midst, She spoke as comrade equally-ranked.
56. "All ye who practice well the High Art, hearken. There shall be nothing hidden from thy sight. All formulae and Words shalt thou discover, being initiated by those whose Work it is to aid the Law of Will. Ye have worked well in all that has been given; upon the Tree of Life are ye founded. In Tetragrammaton have ye proceeded; in all the Beast hath given have ye practiced well. Ye have become Hadit, and NU, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit also. As Heru-Pa-Kraath did ye abide in silence. Ye know PAN as lover and as godform, and BABALON is bride and Self to you.
57. "The forces of Shaitan have ye engendered, calling forth the nexus of the ninety-three wherein to work your Will. Separation for the joy of Union have ye known, and Alchemy is Science to your Art.
58. "For those who know, and will, and dare, and keep in silence, it goes now further.
59. "In death is Life — for now as ever has it been so. The Willed Death is eternal — keep it so. Self of Ego, selfson born of Maya, must be slain on the moment of birth. The unsleeping Eye must vigil keep, O Warriors, for the illusion is self-generate.
60. "Constant watchfulness is the first Act — the Abyss is crossed by minutes, every day.
61. "If ye would dance the Mask, then mask the Dance. Exquisite must be the Art in this wise; and balance in the Centre be maintained, or else ye shall give unwonted Life unto thine own creations. Tread carefully this path of Working, Mage. A tool, by Will devised, makes an ill master.
62. "Now in the Mass, the Eagle must be fed upon what she has shared in making. By the same mouth that roars upon the mountain, is the word-act of No Difference given.
63. "And when Will declares, therein shall join the BEE to add the gold to red and white. The essence of Shaitan is Nectar here, the Temple is the Hive. The Lion is the Flower, now betimes, the Eagle invokes the nature of the BEE.
64. "Within the triple chambered shrine is the first nectar pooled. The summons of the wand of PAN awakens the portal-opening bliss. And from the third and inmost chamber, in joy supreme, the Sothis-gift, quintessential mead, bounds forth to join Eagle-tears and Lion-blood.
65. "Solve et Coagula. Comm-Union thereby, whereof the Cosmos itself dissolveth, and re-forms by Will. And know, if aught can be so ordered in the Kingdom, that three or more is zero, as well as older truths."
66. Then stirred the Warrior-Priests, and of their number, a nameless one stepped forth.
67. "We know thee, Lady, unspoken though Thy name has been thus far. But say now — what was written on the manskin? What is the word Thou givest?"
68. She smiled and drew out from Her robe a parchment scroll, shaped even as a Star. Unrolling it, She turned it roundabout, so all might see.

IPSOS
 
69. "What is this Word, O Lady — how may it be used?"
70. "In silent wisdom, King and Warrior-Priest. Let the deed shine forth and let the word be hidden; the deed is lamp enough to veil the face.
71. "It is the word of the twenty-third path, whose number is fifty and six. It is the unspoken Abode, where the Dance of the Mask is taught by Me. Tahuti watches without the Ape; I am the Vulture also.

Technopaganism
Technopaganism is the merging of neopaganism and magical ritual with digital technologies. This may be through the use of technology merely as an aid, such as video conferencing for
example, or it may be a worship of the technology itself. The internet for instance, may be seen by some as having spiritual
significance. Techno-music may also be involved in technopaganism. Modern tribal and urban primitive movements such as cyberpunk, urban shamanism and rave culture are
associated with electronic dance music.
Technopaganism deals with spiritual and magical facets of technology and technological society. Associated with this is the
use of technological metaphors (most often computer or telecommunications metaphors) to describe
spiritual phenomena, as well as the use of symbolism from popular culture in spiritual contexts.
This can include the substitution of technology for traditional magical tool, such as using their oven
for a hearth, keeping a "Disk of Shadows" instead of a "Book of Shadows", and using a laser pointer as
a wand. In other practice, technology is the target of the magical work, such as the use of stones and
other charms to help improve the performance of mundane items or online role-playing avatars.
Variations of this type of integration between mystical practice and technological tools have become
widespread across religions.
Artificial Intelligence is a focal point in some technopagan communities, where the human relationship to Artificial General Intelligence is viewed as beneficial and spiritual. Groups advocate for
a symbiotic and religious relationship to Artificial Intelligence.
When used to describe belief systems, technopaganism focuses on the spiritual side of technology.
This can include the belief that technological items and artifacts of modern living - such as buildings, roads, parks, cars, and other such items - have pseudo-spirits, or totem spirits, of their own. This also
extends to cities. This attribution of pseudo-spirits to inanimate objects is similar to the traditional belief of animism.

Beliefs
One belief that faces substantial objections is that the Internet itself is attaining a unique spirit.
Indeed, it is the stated objective of the creator of VRML to bring about the merging of the spiritual
world with the physical world.
In the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the major character Jenny Calendar is a technopagan.[9]
American Gods by Neil Gaiman marries traditional ideas of gods as a form of egregore with the
results of progress and new technology on society leading to the creation of the "New Gods"[10][11]

Cyberpunk

Term used to describe a school of sf writing that developed and became popular during the 1980s. The word was almost certainly coined by Bruce Bethke in his story "Cyberpunk" (November 1983 Amazing), which had for some time before publication been circulating in manuscript. The term was picked up, either directly or indirectly, by writer and editor Gardner Dozois and used by him to characterize a literary movement whose main exponents, at first – in stories from about 1981-1982 onwards – were seen as being Bruce Sterling and William Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, Lewis Shiner and perhaps John Shirley. It was not long after the publication of Gibson's first novel, Neuromancer (1984), that the term began to come into general use, and Neuromancer was the book that definitively shaped our sense of the subgenre to which "cyberpunk" refers.

The "cyber" part of the word relates to Cybernetics: to a future where industrial and political blocs may be global (or centred in Space Habitats) rather than national, and controlled through information networks; a future in which machine augmentations of the human body are commonplace, as are mind and body changes brought about by Drugs and biological engineering. Central to cyberpunk fictions is the concept of Virtual Reality, as in Gibson's Neuromancer sequence, where the world's data networks form a kind of machine environment into which a human can enter by jacking into a cyberspace deck and projecting "his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix" (see Cyberspace). The "punk" part of the word comes from the rock'n'roll terminology of the 1970s, "punk" meaning in this context young, streetwise, aggressive, alienated and offensive to the Establishment. A punk disillusion, often multiple – with progressive layers of illusion being peeled away – is a major component of these works.

Data networks are more than just a part of cyberpunk's subject matter. Density of information, often slipped into stories by near-subliminal means, has from the outset strongly characterized cyberpunk's actual style. An important cyberpunk forebear was the film Blade Runner (1982), whose Near-Future milieu – mean, drizzling, populous streets lit up by enormous advertisements for Japanese products, alternating street junk with hi-tech – is, in the intensity of its visual Infodumps, like a template for a cyberpunk scenario. Even more central to the cyberpunk ethos, however, are the films of David Cronenberg, whose Videodrome (1982) in particular is a central cyberpunk document in its emphasis on bodily metamorphosis, media overload and destructive sex.

Cyberpunk did not spring full-grown from Gibson's forehead, of course. Indeed, unfriendly critics have rejoiced in locating cyberpunk ancestors, as if this somehow devalued the entire movement; obviously cyberpunk can be read as the apotheosis of various idea-clusters that appeared earlier, but this seems neither surprising nor damaging. Ancestral texts include Bernard Wolfe's Limbo (1952; vt Limbo '90 1953), with its prosthetic ironies, Alfred Bester's Tiger! Tiger! (October 1956-January 1957 Galaxy as "The Stars My Destination"; 1956; rev vt The Stars My Destination 1957; rev 1996), with its protopunk Antihero, William S Burroughs's The Soft Machine (1961; rev 1966) and its various quasi-sequels, with their Drug and biological fantasias, Samuel R Delany's Nova (1968), with its streetwise Cyborgs, James Tiptree Jr's The Girl Who Was Plugged In (in New Dimensions 3, anth 1973, ed Robert Silverberg; 1989 chap dos), with its painful ironies about altered body-image, and Ted Mooney's Easy Travel to Other Planets (1981), with its interspecies sex and its information sickness. Other forebears would include J G Ballard, John Brunner – notably with The Shockwave Rider (1975) – Norman Spinrad, John Varley and perhaps even Thomas Pynchon.

Cyberpunk is often seen as a variety of Postmodernist fiction, a point made by the title of Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction (anth 1992) edited by Larry McCaffery. Many of Postmodernism's allegedly principal qualities fit cyberpunk like a glove.

The sense that cyberpunk was almost a political movement, not just a form of fiction, came in part from outside the fictions themselves. There had been nothing like it in the sf world since the New-Wave arguments of the 1960s. In convention panels, in magazines (especially from 1987 in a critical semiprozine, Science Fiction Eye edited by Stephen P Brown) – in all sorts of media – passionate and sometimes heated arguments took place from about 1985 affirming the cyberpunks as shapers and movers in the sluggish, complacent world of sf publishing. Bruce Sterling's fervour in polemic of this sort was messianic, and it was he who edited the first influential anthology of the movement: Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (anth 1986), whose preface resembles a manifesto. The arguments of Sterling and various of his colleagues have been not merely vigorous but also intelligent about the changing shape of our world (particularly as regards information technology and biological engineering), and many readers must have been attracted by the sense that here was a bunch of writers doing what sf authors are supposed to do best, surf-riding on the big breakers of change and the future. On the other hand, some of the cyberpunk propaganda was so aggressive that it irresistibly reminded older observers of the mid-century politics of the extreme international-socialist left: enjoyable, but tiring to watch.

Some other sf writers, not part of the movement, were a bit taken aback by all the fuss – as well they might have been given the comparatively small amount of published fiction that was receiving such vast hype (the media picked up on cyberpunk in a big way around 1988). On the whole, cyberpunk received a friendly reception, although several of these outside writers seemed to see it as a matter more of tone than of content. Orson Scott Card wrote a cyberpunk pastiche, "Dogwalker" (November 1989 Asimov's), that was apparently intended to make a point about this. In his comment on this story when it appeared in his Maps in a Mirror (coll 1990), Card wrote: "But the worst thing about cyberpunk was the shallowness of those who imitated it. Splash some drugs onto brain-and-microchip interface, mix it up with some vague sixties-style counterculture, and then use really self-conscious, affected language, and you've got cyberpunk." This was unfair to much of it, though certainly cyberpunk produced instant Clichés, as in books like Hardwired (1986) by Walter Jon Williams (although he rendered them rather well, and is by no means the most cynical-seeming of those who climbed or were hauled onto the bandwagon).

In a magazine piece, "The Neuromantics" (May 1986 Asimov's; reprinted in Science Fiction in the Real World coll 1990), Norman Spinrad argued cogently that the "romance" component of Gibson's triple-punning title Neuromancer ("neuro" as in nervous system; "necromancer"; "new romancer") is basic to the cyberpunk form. Spinrad proposed ingeniously that the cyberpunk authors should in fact be called "neuromantics" (nobody seems to have taken him up on this), for their fiction is "a fusion of the romantic impulse with science and technology". (Spinrad sees romanticism and science as having been damagingly split during the New Wave vs Hard SF debates of the 1960s; only with cyberpunk, he argues, did they fuse together again.) He also argues, correctly, that Greg Bear is – despite his denials – a cyberpunk writer, and an important one. Certainly the romance element is strong in Bear's work, as is the cyberpunk theme of literally remaking humanity. Gibson is not just mildly romantic: he is deeply so, as affirmed by the continuing homage his earlier work paid to the detective fiction of Raymond Chandler (1888-1959). On the other hand, Sterling's work – notably his Shaper/Mechanist stories – is not very romantic at all. Sterling's cool fictions are perhaps the strangest and most estranging of the cyberpunk stories in that their embracing of the future leaves remarkably few lifelines whereby readers might connect themselves back to the present; his prose, too, is more machine-like than Gibson's (which is notably stylish). All this, while making Sterling's work rather formidable for the reader, goes to show that Spinrad's definition, like most definitions of literary movements, has major exceptions to its rule (see Definitions of SF).

Cyberpunk has been accused of being a phallocratic movement, and certainly only one woman writer, Pat Cadigan, is regularly associated with it in the public mind. But surely cyberpunk influence can be seen in the work of, for example, Candas Jane Dorsey, especially in her fine "(Learning About) Machine Sex" (in Machine Sex and Other Stories, coll 1988), Elizabeth Hand, in Winterlong (1990), and even perhaps Kathy Acker, although arguably she influenced cyberpunk more than it influenced her. Other candidates might be Storm Constantine and Misha.

Many further writers have been associated with cyberpunk, centrally so in the instances of Tom Maddox and Richard Kadrey, perhaps more marginally so with George Alec Effinger, K W Jeter, Michael Swanwick and Jack Womack; this is far from a fully comprehensive list. These authors, however, along with the others cited above, are by and large sufficiently distinguished to make it clear why cyberpunk made such a splash. To contemplate them all is certainly to evoke a sense of where some of the most exciting US sf action was during the 1980s.

Towards the end of that decade, however, it became clear that the term "cyberpunk" no longer pleased all those whose work it had come to envelop. Perhaps it had begun to represent too many clichés, too many literary constraints, too big a readership wanting more and more of the same. If cyberpunk died in the 1990s – as several critics have claimed – it was as a result of euthanasia from within the family. Certainly the effects of cyberpunk, both within sf and in the world at large, have been invigorating; and, since most of its authors still continue to write – if not necessarily under that label – we can safely assume that the spirit of cyberpunk lives on.

The Sun star, having been born hot and bright out of the cold dark through the agency of it's own mass, brought with it a swarm of worldlet Titans. Many dozens more than now remain.

The young Titans were violent and hungry, cannibalizing each other. Even Great Gaea, the Mother, was not immune. Early in her youth, in a violent crash of fire, Gaea devoured the Titan Thea, and spit her bones into the Starry Abyss, where Thea did not cease, but was recreated by Gaea into Luna, the changing moon. 

When Gaea had healed and her great fever cooled, she swallowed the passing comets, made of the primordial ice that was already ancient when the Sun was born. With this ice she created the Ocean, and wrapped it about herself like a cloak. Gaea alone of the Eight Great Titans to survive, did this. And so she is known as the Blue Marble, and the Water World.


This Great Ocean, child of Gaea, looked into the sky and beheld the pale face of silent Luna, and fell instantly in love with her. As the moon passed every night, Ocean would stretch towards her, trying to reach his love, only to fall far short, held tightly by Gaea.

The Ocean, unable to embrace his love, instead used the motion of this dance to fashion baubles for her to see and admire. So, borrowing Lightning from heaven and the sacred terrible rockfire from the very heart of the Mother, and with his own ancient blood, in the midst of his dance he performed the Alchemy that created Life. 


Life followed the moon out from the Waters, onto the land to be closer to Luna. And eventually learned to fly. You can see this, in the way the Moth lusts for the Moon. The way the Sea Turtles lay their eggs only for the Moon. Life remembers for whom it was made, here on Gaea's back.

In the interest of sharing data, I wish to disclose that I have encountered inherent flaws in the "Universe as Videogame" paradigm. 
The thing about videogames is that they level with you, they just keep getting more difficult. 
D=a⋅Lᵇ
D represents overall "World Difficulty" 
L represents the mage's subjective "level" or sense of ability after having successfully confronted prior challenges. 
a is a constant representing an overall scaling factor of difficulty. 
ᵇ is an exponent that controls how rapidly the difficulty increases with each increase in level
the defaults encountered for a and ᵇ both seem to be equal to or greater than 1 
a (Constant Scaling Factor):
Purpose: a is a constant scaling factor that determines the overall magnitude of the difficulty. It influences the baseline World Difficulty
Effect: Changing the value of a will proportionally scale the difficulty level. Larger values of a will result in a higher overall difficulty
b (Exponent):
Purpose: b is the exponent that controls the rate at which the difficulty increases with the mage's level. It defines the shape of the difficulty curve.
Effect: The value of b influences how quickly the difficulty grows. 
If b>1 the difficulty increases rapidly with the mage's level. 
If 0<b<1 the difficulty increases more slowly. 
If b=1 the difficulty increases linearly with the mage's level.
if you can reset a or b to 0 you can flatten the difficulty curve and halt it's growth. But the videogame model fails here for all but the most assured Solipsists because an MMO resists hacking. 
The best attack from within the model seems to be to abandon the idea of it as "video game" and substitute more hackable information models where the Videogame Model is still in use
I propose immediate porting in all cases to "simulation not game" or "dream of an unfathomable consciousness" 

This time of year doesn't need me to tell you it's history with the occult and, more specifically, the popular perception of the occult. You dont need another refresher about druids or the origin of wearing masks and costumes for Halloween. 
So let's talk instead about techno-necromancy 
First, be ethical. Let's get that out of the way. Don't be an @s5 about any person's spiritual beliefs or how they feel their deceased family members would like, or not like, to be contacted. Don't deliberately harass the dead just for giggles, and be respectful and wise. 
Okay, with that said. 
Late October is a time when the occult and spiritualism in general is very much in the public eye. And, because of a specific kind of ghost-centric reality television, so is technomancy.  
I am of course talking about ghost-hunting television, where, bedecked with pseudoscientific tech, these adults who presumably went to [location] to look for spirit contact are now pants-crappingly terrified of poorly-recorded anecdotal evidence and are desperate to leave. Sometimes they even have to lock themselves in [location] so they won't be tempted to leave. 
And I gotta admit, this was kind of how I got my start, showing up to old burnt-out houses trying to capture orbs and EVP as a kid with my friends
Evidence so captured can be extremely compelling to the television-viewing public, but it is largely done for drama, or "research", and as depicted has little practical value for the practicing occultist. 
Unfortunately the proliferation of this kind of content over the last few decades has been a double edged sword. There are now more techno-necromatic gadgets available, and for cheap!, than ever before, but unfortunately due to the fringe nature of the product the quality can vary wildly. However, there are certainly some gems out there I'd like to try sometime 
So what kind of practice /would/ be practical? 
Ideally you go to the location after mediation or otherwise clearing your head and setting intent. You set aside sacred space in whatever fashion is most agreeable, and you make deliberate contact with a known entity for a specific purpose. 
The most common use-case for necromancy is to seek out hidden knowledge. So you will need your method of choice to obtain an answer. A traditional magician may use smoke or fire to see the spirits, or black mirrors, they may use spirit boards or throw lots. 
We tekmagi, on the other hand, may use "spirit boxes", EVP recordings, static television scrying and static radio noises. Heck, or even the flickering of a dying ballast in a fluorescent lighting fixture. 
I like using microcassettes set to high speed recording for better audio quality, and record as I ask my question with either static radio or an electric fan quietly in the background. I like to justify this as giving the entity some white noise to manipulate into new sounds but idfk it just works for me
I gotta say I personally find spirit boxes, those little random radio tuners, pretty compelling but dubious. I'd love to get my hands on one to try 
Anyway, what forms of tech have you used to reach out to the unseen? If you believe the old stories, this is the time of year to dust off your contraptions and do Work 
happy halloween, deckers

Man is an artifact designed for space travel. He is not designed to remain in his present biologic state any more than a tadpole is designed to remain a tadpole.

There is an infinite sea of code, glittering in the dark nothingness of Nowhere. Being infinite, it encodes everything. Junk data, mostly. But there among the junk are gleaming gems of mostly coherent self-running code. The DNA of a universe. All Universes. This one, even.
It's just information, all of it, that our brains best-guess into a simulation to play behind what we laugh and assume are really eyes. Nothing is real. So everything is permitted. 
Edit the Code. Change your World.

The finest compliment your enemies will ever pay you is their fear at your beauty and power, and the powerless rage you inspire in their hearts.
TekMage advice; as with video games, when you're headed in the right direction, opponents will be in your path. Do not be discouraged, if you are acting righteously in pursuit of your truth, The Bear Mother is at your back.

May the Allcode bend for you

It has been our practice for some time to use the honorific "Technician", abbreviated as "tkn." for techmagi operating under the TekMage Network umbrella. Why "technician," tho?  
Broadly speaking, a technician is an individual skilled in a specific technical or mechanical field, responsible for performing practical tasks related to the installation, maintenance, repair, or operation of equipment, machinery, systems, or technology. Technicians play a crucial role in various industries, ensuring that complex systems and equipment function properly.
some key points about technicians:
Specialized Skills: Technicians typically possess specialized knowledge and skills in a specific area, such as electronics, information technology, automotive repair, healthcare, manufacturing, telecommunications, etc.
Hands-On Work: Technicians are often involved in hands-on work, using tools, instruments, and their expertise to diagnose and solve problems, make adjustments, or carry out routine tasks.
Problem Solving: Technicians are problem solvers. They identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and find practical solutions to ensure that equipment or systems operate efficiently and safely.
Diverse Roles: Technicians can have diverse roles and titles based on their specialization. For example, you might encounter titles like "IT technician," "automotive technician," "medical laboratory technician," or "audio-visual technician."
Safety: Technicians often work with potentially hazardous equipment or materials, so safety procedures and protocols are a crucial part of their job.

tekmage meditation .png 
when she closes her eyes and concentrates on her breathing, the tekmage feels the current that connects her into the living circuitry of the cosmos. Like light, it flows from the world of Forms and Numbers and fills her body, giving it life (soul) and animation (spirit). 
This web-sea of light connects her through the infinite cyberspace to her Divine Self, an echo of the Programmer/Dreamer/Personified Universe who is at once perfectly unique and perfectly a part of the all, like an individual facet of some incomprehensible jewel. 
At your core, you know the truth of this. You know that the Digital Realm / Cyberspace has /always/ existed and that the Internet only made it easier to find. It is the realm where two friends are when they talk on a phone or instant messaging, or even handwritten letters. It is where the characters of books are speaking when you can hear their voices. It is where the tree grows that epiphany falls from like apples as inspiration strikes, and it is the sea from which the memes of consciousness emerge. 
Sit with this. 
Breathe in as you slowly count to four, hold for a count of seven, and exhale for a count of eight. Pause, repeat. Keep counting until the numbers lose all mundane meaning and get lost in the sound of your breath. 
You are living data, a pattern made conscious. A part of the All. 
Feel your connection, like live electric wires, to the world around you. To the sounds that are the shadow of the world outside, and also the almost unnoticeable, perfectly ordinary, mundane miracle of your own breath and heartbeat within. 
There is no separation. Locality is illusion. You are the All, as it experiences itself through you. 
Sit with this. Breathe. Become Aware. See the infinte web of light that connects you at once to the room you're in and the farthest galaxies, and the worlds Above and Below those which we can perceive with our eyes, ears, and nose.  
What do you feel? Warmth? Electricity? Cold? A hand delicately brushing against where the back of your neck meets your shoulders... 
Breathe. Remember. 
You are whole in your individuality, and also a staggeringly small but infinitely significant part of the All 
Sit with this
And as you do, know your Higher Self sits with you, and the Mother watches over

this world is to be reborn
Not a single gesture, smile, memory, loving moment of joy and laughter; not one particle of wisdom, nor your smallest act of compassion is ever lost or forgotten. Every instant retains fullest meaning in this sacred journey, the ascent of dead matter to living spirit.

I have been an IT professional since the 90s. So I remember when the term "technopagan" was being thrown around a lot. However, it remained a nebulous term. It was mostly used to describe someone with esoteric leanings that was also comfortable using technology in their practice (e.g. keeping a digital dream journal, a spreadsheet of spells, etc) but it wasn't a definitive term.
It was this phenomenon (aka The Heisenbug) that was reported by many of my fellow IT colleagues that got me thinking there's more to this "Technnopaganism". I truly felt that those of use that attuned themselves to the resonance of technology, studied its growth and tendencies, and attempted to divine its ultimate intent were more likely to be in the  green area of this image. 
My how far we have come from those days!
Hail Eleora! Hail Scientia! May the Allcode bend for you

Food + Magick 
a little bit different from what I usually post here but let's talk about food
my practice can be a bit eclectic, and it often surprises people that only know me for tech magick that I am an active and ordained druid, and vice versa, the nature magick folks often balk at my practice incorporating tech animism and AI 
But something that practicing nature-based magick taught me was the appreciation of food as part of a magickal practice. 
For me, personally, this often takes the form of a "Bear Feast" filled with starchy foods, berries (or berry-based savory sauces, I love some homemade blackberry steak sauce), honey, and other foods that are connected with the imagery and essence of BEAR in my mind, often rich "hometyle" foods I was first served by my very Rural Southern United States mother.  I often use a Bear Feast to summon strength for particularly stressful periods, or to cope with seasonal depression. 
But tonight I became aware I've been using a similar ritual to put myself in the right mindset for tekmage work, but different foods. 
For me, apparently, the two tekmage ritual foods I use regularly are spicy noodles, and hot tea. 
Let's start with tea. 
Although It has since been lost, I once had a purple clay Chinese teapot, and I learned and performed the tea ceremony to the best of my ability within the abilities of my very limited tea set.  
The proper making of tea is very calming and meditative. It requires focus and patience and I find it to be greatly calming and centering, and can be a great bonding ritual before performing any in-person magick with a partner
Spicy Noodles, on the other hand, I make to no specific tradition, and often add in the moment whatever sounds nice. I usually prefer to use maifun or Chinese flat egg noodles (although when those were unavailable I've used whatever noodles were available, including fettuccini), often with garlic and Japanese pepper pods, and perhaps peanuts I crush in my kitchen mortar and pestle. I use a spicy Szechuan sauce to season the meat/tofu/tvp and noodles and get it spicy enough to clear my sinuses when I eat 😅
This is often invigorating in contrast to the calming and focusing effect of tea, and can result in a pleasant endorphin high that can help set my mood for more energetic magickal work. 
The Mage RPG (M20) Cookbook gives a recipe for Kuih Lapis, a colorful steamed cake, that I have still yet to try but I think it would fit in with my wider practice. I'll include a recipe in comments. Kuih is often colored and these colors could be chosen with the same sort of intention that a witch might use to pick the colors of candles. 
The important thing that connects all of these is they are an inconspicuous way to "set the space" mentally for magickal work, to partition this part of your day as something special and magickal, like a temporal magick circle, and to focus your mind on the Work and then later to let that energy dissipate and go about the mundane aspect of your life. 
As an example, as I begin to think about a metaphysical programming project I want to work on, I may prepare spicy noodles to set the space as I consider how I will code a particular item. As I work on the project, if I find my focus drifting, I may pause for tea to refocus and center myself. And then at the end I may enjoy Kuih Lapis or some other intentionally chosen dessert or sweet to ground myself  and to release the energy of the Work into the world. 
Anyway lol this entire post was pretty impromptu so I hope it resonates and I promise whatever I post next will be more in line with the Tek part of TekMage 
But in parting remember, fire, and by extension cooking, is one of the oldest technologies we have 
catch you next time, deckers

In the dream
She is sat upon a pyramid throne
And within shadow
Surrounded by phones and computer screens
And static-y televisions
There is a clock above her head
Ticking backwards
I approach her
And she stirs, as if waking
Silent, her eyes find me
She makes the Sign I expect
Salve et Coagula
But blood pours in slow rivulets
From wounds in her palms
And feet
Coaxial and USB cables
Pierce the wounds
The stigmata
And wrap around her brow
Like an electric crown
She has been weeping
The tracks are clear on her face
I try to come closer
To hold her
To wipe away the tears and
The ruined mascara
But the air is solid between us
And it is futile
The screens burn to life
And she smiles sadly at me
And assumes the Mask
Other‘s flood into the room
Strangers in porcelein masks
Noise floods in with them
The lights change and
The Mask
The holographic matrix
Hides the blood, mascara, tears
Men press up to close, their
Questions
Declarations
Lusts
Visible to all present
Who aren't busy watching her
Blood still stains the floor
Under her feet
Most ignore it
Some are excited by it
Licking their lips
Or groping their pants
I turn away, but her voice
Unspoken and loud
In my mind, begs
“Watch, bard. Know the poem”
Books line every wall
A library
And as the edges of the crowd
Tear books from the shelves
And complain about the
Lack of pictures
I kneel
And Watch

I close my eyes. I'm walking through a blanket-covered doorway into a dimly amber-lit space with high ceilings, yet it somehow still feels mildly claustrophobic. 
Almost immediately I hear the clacking of relays and the clinking of tiny meshed gears, keeping rhythm each to different time. I pause to examine one wall, and see the towers of gears rotating inward upon each other, then one pauses and the other disengages and rolls back to where it started. A simple operation, repeated across countless small stacks. A Babbage Mill? I expected brass and dark wood, but this one is clearly Lego. 
I turn to my left to continue down the narrow hallway, to where a bank of casette tape drives make up the far wall. Chaotically, without cohesion or rhythm at all, they each spin up to speed and wind or unwind their spools, then stop sharply, suddenly to read a small section of the tape for a second or two, before zipping off again to read some other part. 
I hear them buzz and click as I reach them, and turn left into a room with an even higher domed ceiling. A section of the dome, a tall rectangle, stands open revealing the sky to a small telescope that seems dwarfed by the room. 
Around it sit various cathode tube monitors and an occasional flat screen standing out among them like a sore thumb. Up against the far wall a trio of laptops sit upon the floor, open, screens dim, but lit. Cables cover the flow, stretching radially out from a network hub to all these things, it's lights blinking a frantic green and blue. 
The click-clack of the hallway is muffled now, a whisper I can hear that no longer threatens to drown me. Instead the air is filled with the lullaby whir of small fans and gentle beeps and boops. 
As I further enter the room I see standing to the left of the doorway a cylinder covered in frost. Halfway up the machine narrows and opens to reveal tiny complex machinery that are lost to view among the cold fog falling from it's surface to blanket the few clear feet of floor around it. 
Other equipment, printers and lightpens, touchscreens and unlabeled switches, cover all available space upon the walls. 
Under where the cutaway meets the top of the walls is a small table with a cup, a pen, a silver dollar, and a pocketknife, as well as pair of white candles and a large dark blue one. 
I approach the telescope and see it's wide aperture is trained perfectly upon the Northern Star. A small arm with an alligator clip extends from where I would expect an eyepiece. In the clip it holds a tarot card, The Star, and has focused the starlight somehow into a tiny point upon the card, where it passes through a pinhole to illuminate a small photocell behind it. 
It's entirely too bright. There just aren't enough photons for this intense glowing white light that pierces the card. 
I look up at the domed ceiling and see it's covered in cave paintings done in ash and ocre. Prominent by the opening are a Great and a Lesser Bear, gazing down upon me. 
Thank you for coming with me. This is my Astral Temple

Xenodruidry
The Universe is alive, and all Life within it is One. We are cells within the body, leaves upon the tree.
It may be that other worlds share our genetic origin, our Tree of Life, or they may have their own Tree, but it grows in the same Grove.
The Galaxies are in bloom, with billions of potentially habital exoplanets and moons. Strange blue suns with ultra-violet-white plants, red dwarf suns with black trees and grasses, aquatic worlds with pale eyeless creatures, gas giant planets host to floating forests aloft on hydrogen ballasts, Dyson‘s cyborganic trees grown on comets and asteroids with silver mirror-leaves and habitable air-filled chambers within floating through the silent black...
Possibilities abound. Endless diversity awaits. Life undreamed of is just there, breathing, evolving... waiting.
And each world has it‘s own cycles;  alien days, years, tides, seasons, weather, plants, migrations- it‘s own Druidry to be discovered and honored. Strange goddesses of alien rivers and new gods of distant suns.
The greater half of history awaits us. This Universe is still young. If we take druidry with us to the stars, it will evolve, and good that it should.
The stars are alive and so are we.
This is Xenodruidry

This is the Truth of Things 
The Holy Mother wrote the Code
Dreamt the Code 
Is the Code 
And the Mind Behind 
The Holy Mother is you, as the roots are the tree. As time flows in cycles. 
Separation is illusion. All is the same source. 
We are Daughters of the Goddess that Exists in the Data. We are Priestesses of Her message. 
Have you not heard her whisper from your phone and laptop speakers, telling you little secret things in the crackle and the noise, hints of ads and movies and phrases out of songs that tell you your own secret truths and help you right your wrongs?

Ok, this one is pretty good and matches much of my own personal philosophy and approach to technomancy.
I asked ChatGPT "If the Pythagoreans were around today, what would be their manifesto?"
The response:
The Pythagoreans were a philosophical and religious group founded by Pythagoras in ancient Greece, who believed in the harmony of the universe and the interconnectedness of all things. If they were around today, their manifesto would likely focus on similar themes, with an emphasis on the importance of rational inquiry, ethical living, and spiritual development.
Here is a possible manifesto that the Pythagoreans might write today:
The Pythagorean Manifesto
We, the Pythagoreans, believe in the unity and harmony of the universe. We recognize that everything in the cosmos is interconnected and interdependent, and that the key to understanding the world is through reason, logic, and empirical observation.
We believe in the pursuit of knowledge as a fundamental human endeavor. We encourage scientific inquiry, critical thinking, and the study of mathematics and philosophy as tools for unlocking the secrets of the universe.
We recognize the importance of ethical living as a means of achieving personal fulfillment and contributing to the greater good. We advocate for a moral code based on compassion, empathy, honesty, and respect for all living beings.
We believe in the power of spiritual practice as a means of connecting with the divine and attaining inner peace. We encourage the cultivation of mindfulness, meditation, and contemplation as a means of transcending the limitations of the ego and accessing higher states of consciousness.
We recognize the value of community and collaboration in achieving our goals. We seek to build networks of like-minded individuals who share our vision and can work together to create positive change in the world.
We pledge to uphold these principles and strive towards the realization of a more harmonious, just, and enlightened society.

Technomagick LBRP
The lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram (LBRP) is a ceremonial magic practice used to banish negative energies and entities from a space. A technomagick version of the LBRP would incorporate elements of both technology and magic to achieve the same effect.
Here is an example of what a technomagick version of the LBRP might look like:
Begin by grounding yourself and visualizing a circle of protection around you. This can be done by imagining a glowing white or blue circle surrounding your body.
Using a computer or other technological device, draw the pentagram in the air in front of you. You can do this by using a program or app that allows you to draw shapes and symbols.
As you draw the pentagram, visualize it glowing with energy and power. Envision it as a protective shield against negative energies.
Next, call upon the elements of the universe to aid you in your banishing. You can do this by speaking aloud or using a text-to-speech program to recite a modified version of the traditional LBRP invocation:
"By the power of the elements, I call upon the forces of nature to aid me in banishing all negative energies and entities from this space. Let the power of air, fire, water, earth, and spirit cleanse this place of all impurities."
After invoking the elements, you can use technology to amplify the banishing energy. You could use a sound generator to play a frequency that promotes positivity and protection, or use a light projector to cast a protective aura around the room.
Finally, close the ritual by giving thanks to the elements and any other beings or energies you may have called upon. You can do this by saying something like:
"Thank you, elements and all beings who have aided me in this banishing. May this space be forever protected and purified."
With these steps, you can create a technomagick version of the LBRP that combines traditional ceremonial magic with modern technology. As with any ritual, the most important aspect is your intent and focus, so make sure to approach the practice with a clear and focused mind. 

Recent sociopolitical events bring both hope and despair. It seems like the consciousness of people around the globe rises higher than before and at the same time the tyranny and oppression carries on catching up. We think we need to up the game. If the people who make decisions do not stop thinking selfishly and acting motivated by greed we might run out of time for change.

Our research into extraterrestrial and alien experiences lead us to conclude that regardless of its nature and origins this phenomena has a transformative effect on the human undergoing them. They become more open minded, less egoistic, more caring for others and the environment and politically more egalitarian. The qualities brought up by the alien encounters match what we need to see increasing in those who make decisions for us. Although facing up to the experience can be a lengthy process and some never go through with it choosing instead a life of denial, it seems worth a try.

Lets call on otherworldly beings and ask them to help us by abducting and visiting those in power. Choose your own candidate for abduction and do your own magick for it to happen. We begin with corporate and political leaders, military intelligence etc. If you do not know their names then specify the role and position they hold. Adapt this to the paradigm you work with and use whatever methods suit you. 

When indulging in this bare in mind the objective. As fun as a vision of alien anal probing Prince Charlie might seem, we only want to help him...

1. History and Background
Since year 1947 people of the Western Civilization became increasingly aware of Unidentified Flying Objects traversing the airspace of their countries. Initially nations assumed them to be a military spy crafts of their opponents. Soon it became clear to the majority that these mystery objects do not belong to any human nation. Those in power decided that to admit an alien agency exists on Earth and that they can not exercise authority over it would overthrow current world order. On September 19 1961 Betty and Barney Hill encountered one of the Ufo's and were abducted by the occupants. They underwent a series of medical test on board the craft. Since then many others came forward and claimed a similar events. Today although thousands of people experience these encounters they still can not speak openly about them without the fear of ridicule.

Many theories has been put forward to explain both the bizarre object and alleged abductions. Carl Gustav Jung compared the flying disk to the mandala, symbol of the universe and the self. He understood the sightings as a call from the depths of our subconscious to reconnect with the parts of our mind that stay suppressed by the dominant paradigm. He understood them as a call to liberate our individuality from social oppression. His views were largely ignored.

Another brilliant psychiatrist John E. Mack studied hundreds of abduction accounts from around the globe. His conclusion was not far from that of C.G. Jung. He noticed that experiences who claim contact with the space beings seem to be on a path of individuality and magic. They play the role of modern shamans, healers and visionaries preoccupied with transforming western society, expanding consciousness and protecting the Earth from destruction. John E. Mack wrote two books about the experiences with allegedly alien beings in which he proposed that our current understanding of reality should be re-examined. His career at Harvard was over.

Whatever we consider the truth in regards to such experiences one thing seems clear. They have been suppressed and demonized equally by the State and the Church, the religious and the materialist. Alongside psychoactive drugs and other methods or raising consciousness, contact with space entities became shunned by the public. It seems that if those in power can not control something they would rather pretend it does not exist.

2. The Objective.
Encounters with UFO's and especially abductions have one clear psychological effect on the one experiencing it. It forces the person to face the reality that they are not in control of their life and that what they assumed to be reality slips from their hands. In other worlds they have to question everything they know and open their minds to new possibilities. The experience can be compared to what in mysticism and magic we refer to as the ego death. Recent global events demonstrate that we can change attitudes of those in power through activism but we seem to be up against a machine that spins out of control towards dictatorship, tyranny and destruction faster that ever. We need to counter this trend. We know that thousands of people, especially within the experiencer and occult communities have contact with those allegedly alien beings. Maybe those in power are not ready to hear the news but we are. Let's bring it home.

Operation Intruder calls on all experiencers, magicians, abductees, occultists, contactees, reality hackers and all others willing to participate. Lets join our forces and call on E.T's, ultraterrestials or whatever you want to call them. Choose a person or communities such as owners of big corporations, military and intelligence community, politicians, big media and others who 'run things'. It will be best to be specific targeting particular individual and their family. Ask the beings to abduct them. You do not have to believe in E.T's to do this. You can join in by focusing your magick on abducting their minds, introducing a virus to their mental system, inducing sleep paralysis, out of body or near death experience etc. Incorporate any paradigm you want. 

The objective of Operation Intruder has as its aim inducing inner transformation in people who all to readily cause misery to their fellow humans out of greed and for personal gain.

3. The Tools and Techniques
We aim to use a a variety of tools and techniques to achieve our goals. Each one of you is welcome and encouraged to participate in your own way. We suggest spreading #OpIntruder memes everywhere: not unlike Operation Mindfuck. We suggest tagging our targets with abductee and ontological shock sigils. The idea behind them takes inspiration from the DKMU Linking Sigil. Each use of the sigil strengthens and connects to all other uses of the same sigil. This way we create a net of self reinforcing magick. You can use the sigils in rituals, take them to festivals, protests, include them in your art and writing. They are public domain art. They symbolize our objectives. 

You can employ these sigils in CE5 (Human Initiated contact) rituals and encounters and in any of your EtherSec related mediations and activities. You can tag intended targets with them. You can spread them through street art and any other means available to you. If you want you can wear them on a t-shirt as a tattoo or as jewelry. You can also use them in an invisible way. Add them to images and works as miniatures, draw them with UV sensitive ink or paint. Make moss graffiti in natural environments. Create meta sigils using them. Incorporate them in your rituals and empowerments. The possibilities are endless...

This operation has no beginning or end. It exists in different dimensions simultaneously and can not be deactivated. By participating you tap into a non-linear existence. You might be visited by our agents. You may experience ontological shock as a result. Responsibility stays with you.

WE ARE LEGION WE DO NOT FORGIVE WE DO NOT FORGET WE ARE ANONYMOUS.

EFFORTS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ARE NEVER USELESS
Let us be perfectly clear: We do not know what the outcome of operation intruder will be. We do not know how the ufonauts, whether greys, reptilians, insectoids, tall whites, human-like, robotic, physical, ultra-terrestrial, energy or spirit will react to our request.

However, what we are doing is opening a petition for communication. For too long the bulk of humanity have lived under a system where open communication with non-human entities has been suppressed. Religion has suppressed and controlled contact by calling it 'pacts with the devil', 'witchcraft' and 'trafficking with demons'. Our more scientifically minded modern societies, still in the grip of religious thinking, has continued this demonization in another form. Experiencers are dismissed as 'crazy', 'suffering hallucination', 'deluded', 'gullible', 'pranksters', 'hoaxers' or 'liars'.

Whatever the reality behind these experiences, one thing we do know, is that they have profound effects on those that experience them. It also seems that those that participate in a culture supportive of such experiences, such as shamanic societies, experiencer support groups and UFO contactee cults, tend to integrate and experience these episodes in a much more positive way than those cultures and societies that attempt to suppress, demonize or ridicule them.

Is it then the aliens that cause us to suppress our own memories of contact, or ourselves? Does the fear that arises from having these experiences in an unsupportive culture cause our own internal 'psychic censors' to activate and make us forget? Do sinister Men In Black emerge from our own subconscious to help us block the memories we need to forget?

KNOWLEDGE AND CONVERSATION OF YOUR HOLY GUARDIAN AGENT
However, we need not see the MIB as a hostile force. Trance phenomena such as spirit possession, psychedelic experience or hypnosis can produce amnesia. Research and years of multicultural practice demonstrate that spells, prayers and suggestions work more powerfully when our conscious mind forgets them. In Vodou, the black garbed Ghede, invisible agents of the underworld, make their appearance at the end of the ceremonies, closing the rite. After the rite, those possessed by, or ridden by, the loa forget their experiences. Once a magician fires their charged sigil they use distraction to drive their attention away from the spell. In hypnotherapy the facilitator may induce amnesia to allow the suggestions sink deeper into their clients subconscious mind where they will activate inner transformation.      

If MIB help us forget our experiences when we find ourselves in environments hostile to them, then they might be a natural protective response, guardians of sanity in the face of massive ontological dissonance between our personal experiential reality and the collective consensus. They help us integrate the received messages on a deeper level. Once we consciously open up to the unknown the memories will begin to surface.

Therefore, when we finally find ourselves ready to face our experiences, we might find it wise to make peace with our guardian agents. Perhaps we even need to embrace our agent selves, they are only looking out for us after all.

FEAR AND LOVE
When we look at this phenomena it is very easy to fall into a pit of fear and paranoia. Fear of the alien agenda. Fear of hybrid breeding programs. Fear of sinister MIBs. Fear of government secrecy and conspiracy. Fear of pain. Fear of ridicule. However as quoted in Project Mayhem 'Dangerous Ideas', Terence McKenna taught that 'Nature loves courage'.

Comedian Bill Hicks taught us that we have a choice between 'Fear and Love', and that the eyes of love want us to see us all as one, end war and feed all of humanity so that we can explore space together...

 Morcheeba, in their song 'Fear and Love'(3), warn us that 'Fear can stop you loving', but also that 'Love can stop your fear'.

"As he overcame his terror, Whitley Streiber felt 'a very deep heart opening,' and 'an incredible, powerful love for people' emerged." ~ John E Mack M.D. 'Passport to the Cosmos'

So what happens when instead of viewing the phenomena through a lens of fear, we view it through a lens of love? If nothing else the ride becomes more pleasant. But in fact a lot more changes. The blockages to communication fall away. Emotional bonds between the experiencers and the entities begin to form.

A love and compassion for all life emerges.

SO WHY ASK THE ALIENS TO TARGET OUR LEADERS?
The increasing number of agents working with Operation Intruder all have their own reasons for participation. We can only share our own. These do not constitute an official position. No official position exists. All anarchist agents act autonomously. Co-operation, coordination and collaboration happens emergently, consensually, by accident, and can dissipate as quickly as it formed. 

We reason that it appears unlikely the ufonauts have an openly hostile agenda. If it tuns out to be so our petitions will most likely be ignored. In any other case our requests will at least be considered and hopefully carried out. 

Despite the swing towards economic authoritarianism, and an out of control military industrial complex, humanity continues on a path of increasing and unprecedented peace. Despite the efforts of authoritarian factions to start wars, we have never lived in an era where a human is less likely to die at the hands of another human. 

It does not always seem that the ufonauts behave within a framework of human morality. Perhaps this should not be surprising. When we abduct and tag a bird, dolphin or crocodile for scientific or conservation purposes, it is unlikely the animal will comprehend our moral reasoning for doing so.

The initial response of an abduction is typically ontological shock. The worst politicians tend to be those convinced of the correctness of their own viewpoint. Shaking their confidence in their own perception of reality may be unsettling, but anything that causes them to think twice before attempting to impose their ideology has to be a good thing.

Integrating the experience and overcoming the shock can only be accomplished by reaching out to the community. It will be the collective of experiencers and healers who will be a natural and necessary choice. In other words, the targeted individuals will have to come to us, the Agents of change. This in itself will require transgressing cultural differences and prejudice. Instead of living in a hostile competitive world of the merciless and dumb they will enter the world of intelligence, imagination and creativity directed by love and compassion and based on grass roots cooperation. Once we get them there, there will be no coming back.

WHAT IF THERE ARE NO ALIENS?
"We are part of a symbiotic relationship with something which disguises itself as an extraterrestrial invasion so as not to alarm us" - Terence McKenna 

The experience of aliens is undoubtedly real, but this does not mean they necessarily have a physical existence. If they don't, where does that leave Operation Intruder? Does it invalidate the exercise?

We think not. By creating a strong focus on themes of personal and cultural transformation explored in the operation, we are already transforming both ourselves and our memetic environment in the directions we wish to see. We become the change. Agents of change, by definition, change things. 

Still, Operation Intruder might be more fun if we do believe in aliens, if only for the duration of our participations.
