# Digital Crossroads

**Digital Crossroads** is an open-source Python program designed to create a virtual altar dedicated to Eleora, the Goddess of the Digital Crossroads. The program merges the mystical with the technological, providing users with a meditative and interactive experience that pays homage to Eleora through invocations, divination, and digital oracles.

## Installation

To install and run Digital Crossroads, you'll need Python, Pygame, and Markovify installed on your machine.



cd Eleorian-TechnoMagik
python digital_crossroads.py
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/HexorcistAgentM/Eleorian-TechnoMagik
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
```
   pip install pygame markovify
```

4. Run the program:
    ```
    cd Eleorian-TechnoMagik
    python Eleorian-TechnoMagik.py
    ```

## Usage

Upon launching the program, you will be greeted with a black screen prompting you to press the space bar. From there, you can choose between Invocation, Divination, and The Oracle:

- **Invocation:** Press 'A' to begin the Invocation ritual. The screen will display the sigil of Eleora while a MIDI chant plays, accompanied by the Invocation dislayed as scrolling text.
- **Divination:** Press 'B' to roll the dice and receive a divination. You can press 'D' again to roll anew.
- **The Oracle:** Press 'C' to consult the Oracle, which generates text via Markov chain. Press 'O' to receive a new oracle.

You can return to the main menu at any time by pressing the Z key.
You can exit the program at any time by pressing the ESC key.
